        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello my name is Cooper Smith, nice to meet you. Here is a little about me
        I was born and raised in Portland, OR, studied music at Marylhurst Unviversity,
        and moved to New York City when I was 21. After years of Bartending and playing
        music with my band YAASSS, I finally decided to follow my dreams of learning to code
        I am currently enrolled at Columbia Engineering Bootcamp and learing a lot</p>
